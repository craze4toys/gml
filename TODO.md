# TODO
- add qml support for int64
- remove the app completly.
- code gen: use the direct type instead of interface{} -> properties don't return a QVariant.
- don't use C.CString instead use the direct byte buffer?
- use everythwere constData instead of data (strings).
- check with vargrant if any memory is lost
- docker container
- recheck c code for memory bugs. (variants)
- test variant as return type and in functions
- test a qmodel as properties
- package names must be unique if code generation is applied to that package. Fix this or prevent this as compiler check.
